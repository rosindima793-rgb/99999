Default is once every 24 hours, rewards start accumulating\n‚Ä¢ You can skip pings for up to 7 days ‚Äî rewards and bonuses will accumulate automatically\n‚Ä¢ After 7 days without ping, accumulation stops until you ping again\n‚Ä¢ Each successful Ping brings OCTAA ‚Äî amount depends on:\n  - Octagon rarity (Common, Rare, Mystic, etc.)\n  - Your experience bonus ‚Äî grows every 24 hours\n  - Time between pings (if more periods passed, more OCTAA)\n\nüîπ What is Experience Bonus\n‚Ä¢ Initially all octagons have -50% penalty\n‚Ä¢ Every 24 hours your bonus grows by +2.7%\n‚Ä¢ Maximum you can reach +97.2% + rarity bonuses also count\n‚Ä¢ You can skip pings for up to 7 days ‚Äî bonus keeps growing automatically\n‚Ä¢ No penalties for missing pings within 7 days\n‚Ä¢ After 7 days without ping, bonus stops growing until you ping again\n\nüîπ How to Get OCTAA\n‚Ä¢ OCTAA doesn't drop to wallet immediately, but accumulates inside the octagon (this way each NFT has real value)\n‚Ä¢ To collect ‚Äî you need to burn the octagon (Burn) (your octagon goes to graveyard section and no longer belongs to you, you get OCTAA coins in the claim section)\n\nüîπ How to Burn\n‚Ä¢ Go to Burn section\n‚Ä¢ Choose octagon and waiting time:\n  - 30 minutes ‚Üí 50% to player\n  - 120 minutes ‚Üí 70%\n  - 480 minutes ‚Üí 80%\n‚Ä¢ The rest is split between pool and permanent burning (goes to official dead wallet)\n‚Ä¢ After chosen time, go and press Claim ‚Äî OCTAA will come to your wallet\n\nüîπ How to Revive Octagon (Breed)\n‚Ä¢ Go to Breed section\n‚Ä¢ Choose 2 living octagons (with at least 1 star and not in cooldown)\n‚Ä¢ Select gender for each octagon: male or female (both genders required for breeding)\n‚Ä¢ Pay fee: 40% (10% CRAA + 30% OCTAA) of minimum marketplace price\n‚Ä¢ Random NFT from graveyard will return to you as new, with all stars but no coins:\n  - Bonus is reset (back to -50%)\n  - Stars are restored\n  - 48-hour cooldown period begins\n  - Can ping again from scratch after cooldown\n\nüîπ Where OCTAA is in the System\n‚Ä¢ OCTAA for Ping comes from monthly reward pool\n‚Ä¢ OCTAA spent on Breed returns to this pool\n‚Ä¢ OCTAA from Burn burns forever\n‚Ä¢ Everything burned goes to special wallet 0x...dead and disappears forever\n\nüîπ OCTAA Token Fees\n‚Ä¢ 3% fee on transfers ‚Äî goes to game contract\n‚Ä¢ 10% fee on DEX sales ‚Äî goes to game contract\n‚Ä¢ 0% fee on DEX purchases ‚Äî no fee when buying\n‚Ä¢ All fees support the game ecosystem and reward pool\n\nüîπ Example Strategy\nYou have three octagons:\n‚Ä¢ Common (regular) ‚Äî ping it, bonus grows by 2.7% every 24 hours up to 97%, then stops. Can sell, transfer NFT, bonus is preserved and locked coins in NFT are also preserved\n‚Ä¢ Rare ‚Äî use for Breed or accumulate OCTAA\n‚Ä¢ Mystic ‚Äî rare, brings more OCTAA, better not to burn\n\nPlay calmly:\n‚Ä¢ Ping when convenient ‚Äî you can skip up to 7 days without penalties\n‚Ä¢ Rewards and bonuses accumulate automatically during this time\n‚Ä¢ Periodically burn weak octagons ‚Üí get tokens\n‚Ä¢ Or revive dead ones ‚Äî get chance for rarer one\n\nüí° Tips\nWant maximum profit ‚Äî ping regularly and don't burn rare octagons too early.\nüí• Burned tokens won't return ‚Äî this increases the value of remaining OCTAA.\n\nüöÄ Our Vision\nOur plans within 1-2 months are to adjust the gameplay and renounce admin rights on NFT and token contracts. We want to conduct a social experiment and create fully social gameplay where there are no possibilities to change anything ‚Äî only market and people decide.\n\nThe team has no bonuses in the contract in the form of OCTAA coins. You can create a wallet, for example, in Rabby wallet in 1 minute and play our game.\n\nSoon our game will be 100% decentralized with market self-regulation.."
