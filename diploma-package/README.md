# Diploma Package

This folder contains a minimal, documented package for publishing the diploma project to GitHub.

Included:
- `DEPLOY.md` — step-by-step deploy instructions (Netlify + GitHub).
- `install.ps1` — local PowerShell installer to prepare environment and run build.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow to build and run security checks on PRs.

Use these artifacts to push the final deliverable to the target repository.
